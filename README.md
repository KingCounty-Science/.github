# Welcome

Beka Stiling formed this organization in order to connect staff within King County's Science and Technical Support Section. If you are a KC Science staff member, please request to join the group! I plan to put a post in Teams in early July to try to get GitHub users connected. I've created this group in the meantime, in order to practice forming a group!

## Goal

- Connect Science Section staff scientists in order to grow and develop open and reproducible science practices.
- Allow Science Section projects to be shared among Science Staff, even if repos are otherwise private.
