# Welcome

Beka Stiling formed this GitHub organization in order to start connecting staff within King County's Science and Technical Support Section. If you are a KC Science staff member and you stumbled upon this group, please request to join the group! I (Beka) plan to put a post in Teams in early July 2022 to formally start to get GitHub users connected. I've created this group today (June 16) to learn how to form a GitHub group and check out some of the features.

## Goals

- Connect Science Section staff scientists
- Collectively grow and develop open and reproducible science practices.
- Easily share Science Section technical projects and code with one another, even if repos are otherwise private.
